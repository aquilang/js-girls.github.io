  text: JS Girls is a one-day workshop with the aim of helping women getting to know the world of JavaScript, the most used programming language in the world.
---

## ABOUT

During the day, tutors will follow you and guide you through the creation of a basic application. This experience will give you the instruments to get an idea of how it is to be a developer. Don’t worry if you don’t understand everything, JS Girls is not a training course and we don’t have the presumption to teach you how to program in one day. Our objective is to give you the instruments to know if JavaScript is something you could like or not.

JS Girls doesn’t want to be a “women only” JS Club, it aims to be the starting block to help you stepping inside a world that, sadly, is almost exclusively made of men.

## Organize

Do you want to organise JS Girls in your city? Fill out this form, it will be a way to know each other better. From our side, we’ll give you all the support you need to make your event a success!

### FAQ How is the workshop structured?

The first part of the morning, after a quick round of introductions, will see a short introductory talk about Web Development and JS. People will then split in tables with four attendees and one tutor each, and we’ll start building our web application.

### I’m interested in being a tutor, what exactly will be my role during the workshop?

You’ll receive some documentation explaining step by step how to build the web application. This is so that every group will develop it in the same way. You’ll be assigned to a table and follow the attendees while they develop. Try to engage them as much as possible, and explain every step, avoiding to transform the workshop in a dictation. If you decide to be a tutor, we count on the fact you won’t fail to transmit your enthusiasm and your love for programming. This is probably the most important thing!

### Support
JS Girls is possible not just thanks to the wonderful volunteers that give their own free time, but also thanks to the sponsors that cover the expenses that are necessary to organise this kind of event.
