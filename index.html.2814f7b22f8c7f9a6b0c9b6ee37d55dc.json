This experience will give you the instruments to get an idea of how it is to be a developer. Don’t worry if you don’t understand everything, JS Girls is not a training course and we don’t have the presumption to teach you how to program in one day. Our objective is to give you the instruments to know if JavaScript is something you could like or not.</p>\n<p>JS Girls doesn’t want to be a “women only” JS Club, it aims to be the starting block to help you stepping inside a world that, sadly, is almost exclusively made of men.</p>\n<!--\n## Organize\n\nDo you want to organise JS Girls in your city? Fill out this form, it will be a way to know each other better. From our side, we’ll give you all the support you need to make your event a success!\n\n### FAQ How is the workshop structured?\n\nThe first part of the morning, after a quick round of introductions, will see a short introductory talk about Web Development and JS. People will then split in tables with four attendees and one tutor each, and we’ll start building our web application.\n\n### I’m interested in being a tutor, what exactly will be my role during the workshop?\n\nYou’ll receive some documentation explaining step by step how to build the web application. This is so that every group will develop it in the same way. You’ll be assigned to a table and follow the attendees while they develop. Try to engage them as much as possible, and explain every step, avoiding to transform the workshop in a dictation. If you decide to be a tutor, we count on the fact you won’t fail to transmit your enthusiasm and your love for programming. This is probably the most important thing!\n\n### Support\nJS Girls is possible not just thanks to the wonderful volunteers that give their own free time, but also thanks to the sponsors that cover the expenses that are necessary to organise this kind of event. Do you want to sponsor JS Girls? Let’s talk about it! You can also support JS Girls as a global or local media partner, or helping us to spread what we do and our events.\n-->\n","__filename":"index.md","__url":"/","__resourceUrl":"/index.html","__dataUrl":"/index.html.2814f7b22f8c7f9a6b0c9b6ee37d55dc.json"}
